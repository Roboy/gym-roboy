The script "multiple_terminals_example.sh" is just an example to see how to with tmux.

Why do we might need tmux?
For example, when we execute the command "roscore" in a terminal, this terminal will be blocked. Therefore, you cannot work with it anymore.
On Google Cloud, where we have only one terminal at a time, we would be lost.
This is where tmux comes to our aid. With shortcuts it is possible in tmux to open a new terminal.
Moreover, tmux can also be started by a script with multiple horizontal or vertical split terminal-windows each performing a different command.
